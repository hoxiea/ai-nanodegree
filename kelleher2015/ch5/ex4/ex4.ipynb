    "\n",
    "To measure similarity, we'll use a **similarity index**. If our three choices are Russell-Rao, Sokal-Michener, and Jaccard, I think that **Jaccard** would be the best choice because it ignores co-absences: items that neither customer has purchased. With such a large inventory, the vast majority of items would be co-absences for any two customers in our database, so by ignoring these, we'll be able to zoom in on the more informative other cases: co-presence, absence-presence, and presence-absence."
